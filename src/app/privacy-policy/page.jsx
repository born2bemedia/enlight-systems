                <strong>Privacy Commitment</strong>
              </h2>
              <p>
                Enlight Systems prioritises customer and user privacy. We only
                request the minimum amount of information necessary, collecting
                only what we consider essential for conducting business or the
                specific transaction. We inform customers about the information
                we hold about them and allow them to opt out of specific
                engagements. Our primary commitment is that we do not generate
                any revenue from advertising. This ensures that we avoid the
                inherent conflict of interest between collecting customer
                information and generating advertising revenue, along with the
                inevitable compromises to customer privacy that such a conflict
                entails.
